## Array Visualizer
Array Visualizer is a simple web application for visualizing operations on arrays. Sometimes it might be hard to imagine how Intersection or Symmetric Difference between arrays will behave - with this tool it will be no longer an issue, you will get your result in a single Visualized Array that should match results in most of the programming languages.

Currently available operations:
* Concatenation
* Union
* Intersection
* Difference
* Symmetric Difference
* Sort
* Unique Sort
